Enclosed find sample files for testing & verification of your program.  The text directory contains the sample files in plaintext before encoding.  The encoded directory contains the sample files after being encoded.  

Remember:

  1.  If you encode a sample text file with your program, it may not match the sample encoded file (.huf) provided, but it must have the same file size (in bytes).  

  2.  If you decode a sample encoded file (.huf) with your program, it must produce an exact copy to the sample text file provided.
